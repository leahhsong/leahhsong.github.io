  <h1>Leah's Story: My Way</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my portfolio! This is a portfolio I created in hoping for you to gain a bit more insights about me. I
    hope you like it. Thank you!</p>
  <p> Who is Leah? </p>


  <p> I'm currently a three-year student at Northfield Mount Hermon. I define myself as a student-athlete and a
    passionate writer. At NMH, I play JV soccer in the fall and I am part of the varsity ice hockey team in the winter.
    I started playing ice hockey at the age of eight. Since then, hockey has been in part of my life for a very long
    time, as my family loved playing winter sports. Other than ice hockey, me and my family enjoyed skiing together. I
    also skied competitively like I played hockey. However, my left leg got fractured after an incident.
    Furthermore, I'm part of Lamplighter, a student newspaper club at NMH. At Lamplighter, I have been publishing
    different articles over the past two years at NMH that you can check out in the spotlight of my recent works down
    below. </p>

  <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, and spending time with my friends and family. One of the most memorable books I read is Atomic Habits by James Clear. I also love exploring new places
    and cultures, which has inspired many of my writings and led me to become a more creative thinker!</p>
